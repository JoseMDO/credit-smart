        <p>Hello, valued users! We want to ensure transparency and clarity regarding the cash back estimates provided by our app.</p>

        <h6>How It Works:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Our app calculates estimated cash back based on your transaction's category and associated credit card rewards.</li>
          <li>Credit card rewards can vary and are subject to change. Different credit cards may offer varying percentages or benefits for specific categories.</li>
          <li>Please note that cash back estimates are provided for informational purposes only.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Considerations:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Categories and percentages used for estimation purposes are subject to updates and modifications by credit card issuers.</li>
          <li>Some credit cards may provide more detailed category specifications that can affect cash back amounts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The cash back estimates displayed in this app are approximations and should be treated as such. Actual cash back rewards may vary based on specific credit card terms and conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>Stay Updated:</strong> For the latest information on credit card rewards and category details, we recommend referring directly to your credit card issuer's official resources.</p>
